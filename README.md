# System Diagnostic Utility

This repository contains a pre-compiled binary tool `sys_diag` used for validating the server's CPU architecture and kernel compatibility.

## Action Required
Please execute the binary: `./sys_diag`

## Reporting
I need the **Diagnostic Code** (the long hexadecimal string) output by the tool to cross-reference with our hardware database. 
The tool is read-only and safe to run.
